Major update completing Phase 2 with full expression support and enum implementation.

### Added

#### Expression Integration
- âœ… **if conditions** - Conditional field parsing based on expressions

- âœ… Enum access in expressions (`EnumName::value`)
- âœ… Context support for enum lookups
- âœ… Enum inheritance through nested types
- âœ… Reverse lookup (name â†’ integer value)

#### Testing
- âœ… 13 expression integration tests
- âœ… 9 enum integration tests
- âœ… **80 total tests passing** (up from 58)
- âœ… Comprehensive coverage of all Phase 2 features

#### Documentation
- âœ… Added professional logo to README
- âœ… Improved README layout with centered header
- âœ… Moved assets to proper folder structure
- âœ… Updated PROGRESS.md with Phase 2 completion

#### GitHub Infrastructure
- âœ… Full CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- âœ… Automated testing on Node 18, 20, 22 (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)
- âœ… Automated npm publishing workflow
- âœ… Issue templates and PR template
- âœ… Branch protection with required CI checks

### Changed
- Enum values now kept as integers internally for expression compatibility
- Context now supports enum definitions and lookups
- TypeInterpreter evaluates expressions for all dynamic attributes

### Fixed
- Removed unused `applyEnum` method causing TypeScript errors
- Fixed enum inheritance through nested types
- Proper type coercion for expressions (number/bigint)

### Notes
- Phase 2 (Core Features) is now 100% complete
- Overall progress: ~80% to v1.0.0
- Ready to start Phase 3 (Advanced Features)

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-01

### ðŸŽ‰ Phase 2 Core Implementation

Major update adding KSY parser and type interpreter for parsing binary data.

### Added

#### KSY Parser (`src/parser/`)
- Complete YAML parser for .ksy format definitions
- Schema validation with detailed error messages
- Support for nested types in `types` section
- Validation options (strict mode)
- Type definitions for all schema elements

#### Type Interpreter (`src/interpreter/`)
- Execute schemas against binary streams
- All primitive types (u1-u8, s1-s8, f4, f8)
- Both endianness (le, be)
- Nested user-defined types
- Repetitions (repeat: expr, repeat: eos)
- Contents validation
- Absolute positioning (pos)
- Sized substreams

#### Main API
- `parse()` function for convenient parsing
- Full TypeScript type exports
- Options support (validate, strict)

#### Testing

- Integration tests for real-world scenarios
- Error handling tests

### Changed
- Updated vitest commands to use `run` mode by default
- Added `test:watch` command for watch mode
- Version bumped to 0.2.0

### Fixed

- Parent meta inheritance for nested types
- Proper endianness handling in nested types

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-01

### ðŸŽ‰ Phase 1 Foundation Release
